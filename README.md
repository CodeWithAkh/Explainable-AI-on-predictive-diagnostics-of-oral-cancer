# XAI on predictive diagnostics of oral cancer using neural networks

## Description
Oral cancer is a viable global public health problem, and early diagnosis is important to increase the survival rate of cancer patients. The importance of inventiveness is highlighted by the fact that the conventional diagnostic techniques involve huge drawbacks concerning accessibility, accuracy, and dependability. This research applies deep learning for improving the diagnostic performance of oral cancer, by using two datasets containing images of lips and tongue and HPS images.  

The proposed work uses a standard benchmark Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is compared with an optimized CNN+VGG16. Propagation through the CNN model reveals an accuracy of about **84.0%** for clinical images and a slightly lower of **72.0%** for the histopathological images. Notably, the CNN+VGG16 model outperforms, with accuracy rates of **92.0%** and **96.0%** respectively, proving a greater ability to develop patterns from within the datasets.  

The **LIME** Explainable AI (XAI) tool is also inculcated within the system to enable the user to understand the patterns and projected outcome. These visualizations increase the level of trust and openness as clinicians and consumers gain insights into the trends likely to affect the diagnosis.
